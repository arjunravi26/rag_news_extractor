Sundargarh: As the Indian armed forces demonstrated their power during the recent Operation Sindoor, a brave jawan of the Border Security Force (BSF) from Odisha played a key role in fighting the enemies on the borders in Kashmir. BSF jawan Manohar Khalkho, who hails from Harasmara area of Sundargarh district, was deployed on the border during Operation Sindoor and also got critically injured while giving a fitting response to Pakistani forces. Manohar, who visited his native place following recovery, narrated how he and his BSF colleagues valiantly fought the enemy at the border in the RS Pura sector of Kashmir throughout the night.
However, two jawans including Manohar were injured in the Pakistani drone attack. Now, after recovering a little, Manohar has returned to his home in Sundargarh. Manohar said his right hand was grievously injured after splinters hit him during drone attack. As a result, he virtually lost his hand. He was welcomed by his family and the district police at the Jharsuguda railway station. Thereafter, Manohar returned to his village. The Indian armed forces had launched Operation Sindoor to give a strong response to the Pahalgam terrorist attack of April 22.
