Listen to Story Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to meet members of the multi-party delegations that were dispatched to 33 countries as part of India's diplomatic outreach following the Pahalgam terror attack and the launch of Operation Sindoor. The meeting is likely to take place in New Delhi on June 9 or 10. The delegations, comprising Members of Parliament from across the political spectrum, senior political leaders, and seasoned diplomats, were tasked with engaging the international community to present India's position and garner global support for its fight against terrorism. According to sources, the upcoming meeting will see the delegations brief the Prime Minister on key developments from their visits - including high-level meetings, strategic conversations, and the responses received from various countries regarding the Pahalgam attack and India's broader counter-terror efforts. In an unprecedented show of bipartisan unity, the government sent seven delegations overseas. Each was led by a prominent parliamentarian: Shashi Tharoor (Indian National Congress) Ravi Shankar Prasad (Bharatiya Janata Party) Sanjay Kumar Jha (Janata Dal United) Baijayant Panda (BJP) Kanimozhi Karunanidhi (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) Supriya Sule (Nationalist Congress Party) Shrikant Eknath Shinde (Shiv Sena) Sources said that the Prime Minister would be apprised of not just the outcomes of these visits but also the tone and substance of global responses to India's message on terrorism, national security, and regional stability. A delegation of MPs led by Baijayant Panda will meet External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar tomorrow at 2.30 pm to brief him about their visit. The delegation, headed by Panda, had visited Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Algeria. Meanwhile, PM Modi will chair a meeting of the council of ministers on June 4 at 4.30 pm, the first after India launched Operation Sindoor in retaliation to the Pahalgam terror attack.Published By: Poorva JoshiPublished On: Jun 2, 2025Tune InMust Watch
