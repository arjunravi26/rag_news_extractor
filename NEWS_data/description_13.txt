Munir Ascends, Pakistan Descends Amid the Militarization of Defeat India Achieves Its Objectives: The Way Ahead Operation Sindoor to Kabul Call: A Two-Front Message to Pakistan Three weeks after Operation Sindoor was paused, a threadbare analysis and post-mortem has begun in earnest. The armed forces are introspecting on what went wrong and which part of the plan they got right. There is no doubt India achieved all the objectives that it set for itself in 20-25 minutes after it was launched on 7 May, thanks to relevant selection of targets and the precision strikes delivered by the military.

The retaliation from Pakistan was also handled equally well with India’s Air Defence rising to the occasion and thwarting almost everything that Pakistan threw at India, save for some minor damage. Many of the platforms, such Brahmos, Akash, Akashteer and MRSAM etc performed exceptionally well during Operation Sindoor. However, there is no guarantee that India will be faced with only Pakistan in any future conflict.
The China-Pakistan nexus on arms, weapons platforms and ISR will surely be more lethal than the one witnessed during Operation Sindoor. Is India prepared for the next war? Will India be able to manage research and development needed for its cutting edge weapons against future threats? That’s the question we posed to a mix of India defence industry stalwarts and a naval Veteran-turned-entrepreneur for the occasional BharatShakti Dialogues last week.
Arun Ramchandani of L&T Defence, Ashok Atluri of Zen Technologies and Commodore Arun Golaya (Retd) faced Editors from the BharatShakti Group, Nitin A. Gokhale, Brig S K Chatterji (Retd), Capt D K Sharma (Retd) and Amitabh Revi of StratNews Global in this fascinating discussion on the way forward in terms of Defence R&D, innovation, manufacturing, faster procurement and greater user-industry interaction.
