Stocks rose last week after a US court attempted to block President Donald Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs. The Manhattan-based Court of International Trade ruled that Trump did not have the sole authority to impose such wide-ranging levies. However, the tariffs were temporarily reinstated after an appeals court agreed to pause the ruling while the White House’s appeal is examined. Over the week to Thursday’s close the S&P 500 and MSCI World indices each rose by 1%.* Meanwhile, US GDP growth contracted at an annualised rate of -0.2% in the first quarter, (Q1) better than the initial estimate of -0.3%, although components showed softer underlying growth. *Factset, as at 29 May 2025 (USD terms) The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has marginally upgraded its UK GDP growth forecast for 2025 and now expects growth of 1.2%, up from its April estimation of 1.1%. However, it left its forecast for next year unchanged at 1.4%, citing that global trade tensions will lower the level of UK GDP by 0.3% by 2026. While the UK was the first country to secure a US trade deal with the US since Donald Trump returned to the White House, the IMF warned that “persistent global trade uncertainty could further weigh on UK growth”. AXA IM forecasts growth of 0.9% and 1.1% respectively. Electric car sales are forecast to surpass 20 million globally in 2025, accounting for more than one-quarter of cars sold worldwide, according to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) Global Electric Vehicle Outlook. The report showed sales were up by 35% year on year in the first three months of 2025. The IEA highlighted that, while the 2025 outlook for sales in the US is uncertain based on current policies, they are “expected to maintain the 10% growth observed in the first quarter”. Despite uncertainties the IEA expects the share of electric cars in total car sales is on course to exceed 40% by 2030. Choose Europe to Start and Scale: A new European Commission (EC) initiative which aims to make Europe a “powerhouse” in terms of starting and growing global technology-driven companies. The strategy forms part of the broader and recently launched ‘Choose Europe’ scheme, which seeks to strengthen European competitiveness. Having recognised the importance of startups and scaleups in Europe’s future, the initiative will address the key challenges these companies face. It will focus on five key areas for action – fostering an innovation-friendly environment, better financing, supporting market uptake and expansion, attracting and retaining top talent and facilitating access to infrastructure, networks and services.

NATO target: 3.5% By the Sunday interviews Healey had reversed his line and said it was only an “ambition” to ramp up spending to that level. This morning on the Today Programme – a couple of hours before the Strategic Defence Review is launched – Starmer could not provide a guarantee: “What I said at the election in 2024 is that we would get to 2.5% and I was pressed time and again ‘what precise date’ and I said ‘as soon as I can be absolutely clear with a firm date, a firm commitment that we will keep to’, because I had seen the previous government make commitments about this percent or that percent with no plan behind it, I’m not going down that road. Therefore, what you can take from this is – yes – that 3% but I am not, as the Prime Minister of a Labour Government, going to make a commitment as to the precise date, until I couldn’t be sure precisely where the money is coming from, how we can make good on that commitment.” Investment recommendations are predicated on an increase in defence spending. No date = no plan…', 'The prime minister said he “very much” hoped he would not need to send British troops into Europe in the future to deter Russian aggression. Asked by BBC Radio 4’s Today programme if UK armed forces could be deployed in the defence of a Nato ally, Sir Keir Starmer said: “In order to make sure that that isn’t the case, we need to prepare.” The UK “cannot ignore the threat that Russia poses,” he added. “Russia has shown in recent weeks that it’s not serious about peace, and we have to be ready.” Sir Keir Starmer said he was buoyed by the footage of Ukraine’s mass drone attack in Russia overnight which is reported to have destroyed 40 Russian planes. “[It shows] Ukraine is not defeated,” he told the BBC. “It shows they are still there and fighting . That is a tribute to Ukraine.” The prime minister said the three-year war between Ukraine and Russia had turned the Ukrainian army into one of Europe’s toughest fighting forces. Sir Keir Starmer rejected suggestions his Labour government could not commit the extra £13 billion to reach the 3 per cent defence funding figure because it was being forced to back down on other measures such as the winter fuel allowance. The government is preparing to reverse its tough cuts to fuel subsidies for pensioners, but the prime minister said it would not come at the cost of defence and security. He said he had fixed the 2.5 per cent defence funding figure to 2027, but the 3 per cent figure would not be tied to a particular date. “I am not going to indulge in the fantasy of plucking dates from the air,” he told the BBC. “I take the defence and security of our country very seriously. It’s the most important task I have.” The prime minister said he was hopeful of reaching the 3 per cent defence funding figure, but made no promises. Sir Keir Starmer said that all Nato countries needed to “step up” to boost defence spending in the current geopolitical environment. He said that defence spending would reach 2.5 per cent by 2027-28, but denied it was “wishful thinking” to hit 3 per cent by next parliament. “Yes, that 3 per cent [is the target]. But I am not going to make a commitment to the exact date until we can make good on that commitment,” he told the BBC. Sir Keir Starmer said the defence strategic review was needed because the “world has changed”, especially since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “We have to recognise the world has changed and if the world has changed we have to be ready,” he told the BBC. If you want to deter conflict, then you have to prepare for conflict.” The prime minister played down the prospect of a future nuclear warfare, but said nuclear deterrence had been an effective tool since the end of the Second World War. “We need to ask how Nato can preserve the peace for decades to come,” he said. Luke Pollard, the armed forces minister, has refused to guarantee that defence spending would reach 3 per cent of GDP, saying it would only happen when “economic conditions allow”. Before the release of the strategic defence review today, Pollard said he hoped to top the 3 per cent figure by the next parliament. “Well, we’ve set out that we are spending 2.5 per cent by April 2027 with the ambition to spend 3 per cent in the next parliament when economic conditions allow,” he told Times Radio. “I agree with the defence secretary that thanks to the chancellor getting our economy back on track by having the highest growth in the G7 that I have no doubt, just as a defence secretary doesn’t, that with the growing threats that we’re facing that we will be spending 3 per cent in the next parliament.” Please enable cookies and other technologies to view this content.

Britain will build up to a dozen nuclear-powered attack submarines, Sir Keir Starmer is expected to announce as the government unveils its strategic defence review on Monday. The long-awaited review will set out the UK’s defence plan for the next ten years. The boats will replace the UK’s seven Astute class submarines, which are armed with conventional weapons, and will be in operation from the late 2030s, joining the four Trident submarines that carry the nation’s at-sea nuclear deterrent.

Registered in England No. 894646. Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, SE1 9GF.', 'Featured: SINGAPORE — The United States is urging Australia to raise defense spending to 3.5% of GDP, almost a third above the target Canberra has set even for the early 2030s, the Pentagon said Sunday. “On defense spending, [Defense Secretary Pete] Hegseth conveyed that Australia should increase its defense spending to 3.5 percent of its GDP as soon as possible,” the statement read, referring to a meeting with Australia’s Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Richard Marles. The two defense chiefs spoke on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, a defense summit in Singapore. In a speech describing the Trump administration’s approach to Asia, Hegseth said the military threat posed by China “could be imminent” and called on U.S. allies in the region to drastically increase defense spending.  Marles said Hegseth had raised the topic in their meeting but didn’t specify a rate. “I don’t think it’s about a particular number,” Marles said in an interview. “America has clearly been articulating that they want their friends and allies to spend more.” During his speech, Hegseth pointed to NATO countries’ recent push to reach defense budgets closer to 5% of GDP — a share the Pentagon’s head of policy has repeatedly said should be the standard for U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific.  “We ask, and indeed we insist, that our allies and partners do their part,” Hegseth said.  Still, the varying signals have left some U.S. allies confused and frustrated at the repeated public calls from Washington to spend more. Australia already plans to raise its defense budget to 2.4% of GDP by 2033-34, up from the about 2% it spends now.  Defense analysts largely see the Pentagon’s statements as a way for the Trump administration to create negotiating leverage — shifting the window of acceptable spending numbers for allied governments. But some also warn it could backfire if the public in other countries starts to see these calls as strong-arming. “We do understand where America is coming from and we’re up to the conversation,” Marles said. “But ultimately, the decisions that we make around defense spending are going to be driven by Australia’s national interest.” Noah Robertson is the Pentagon reporter at Defense News.

When adjusted for the impact of major sporting events, GDP growth came in even stronger at 0.8% qoq. The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs noted that the services sector posted broad-based gains and domestic demand remained firm, contributing to the overall solid performance. A standout was the chemical and pharmaceutical sector, which surged 7.5% in the quarter, driven by a sharp rise in pharmaceutical exports. This lifted overall manufacturing output by 2.1% and goods exports by 5.0%. Notably, exports to the US jumped significantly, suggesting possible front-loading in anticipation of evolving US trade policy.  Full Swiss GDP release here.

'I am not going to make a commitment as to the precise date,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\\xa0 Yesterday Defence Secretary John Healey rowed back on a statement that the increase 'will' happen, stressing that it is an 'ambition'. The Treasury appears to be panicking over how to balance the books as the economy stalls.\\xa0 External authors of the report - expected to be accepted in full by Sir Keir - have suggested that reaching 3 per cent is 'vital' to its success. Key elements of the proposals include:\\xa0 Keir Starmer is facing demands for a cast-iron commitment to spend 3 per cent of GDP on defence today as he unveils a push to get Britain 'war-ready' The Ministry of Defence has already announced plans to build up to 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines (pictured, HMS Astute in service in April)\\xa0 Yesterday Defence Secretary John Healey rowed back on a statement that the increase 'will' happen, stressing that it is an 'ambition' Writing in The Telegraph, Labour former minister Lord Robertson, Russian expert Fiona Hill and General Sir Richard Barrons said the 'Government's important decision to raise Defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2027-28 and, vitally, to 3 per cent in the next Parliament made an enormous difference'. They added: 'The decision established the affordability of our recommendations across a 10-year programme.' Sir Keir will launch the Government's Strategic Defence Review in Scotland, following many months of work and lobbying by military chiefs. But a Nato summit later this month is expected to push for members to hit 3.5 per cent by 2032, while US President Donald Trump has already called for a jump to 5 per cent within the alliance. Mr Healey told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show: 'We have a historic commitment to increasing defence spending to 2.5 per cent in two years' time. We haven't hit that level since Labour was last in power in 2010. And an ambition to meet 3 per cent in the next Parliament.' Challenged that it was an 'just an ambition' rather than a 'guarantee', Mr Healey\\xa0talked about being able to 'deliver the vision' of today's review. Defence minister Luke Pollard again refused to confirm the commitment this morning, telling Times Radio: 'Well, we've set out that we are spending 2.5 per cent by April 2027, with the ambition to spend 3 per cent in the next parliament, when economic conditions allow.' He added: 'Well I've got no doubt that we will get to 3 per cent in the next parliament, as I've said a number of times.' Mr Pollard said the strategic defence review was the 'biggest transformation of our armed forces in 100 years'. He said: 'It seeks to learn the lessons from the war in Ukraine, refresh our capabilities, invest in our people, and underscore that increased defence spending up to 2.5 per cent of our GDP by April 2027 is an engine for growth.' The Ministry of Defence has already announced plans to build up to 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines to boost the Royal Navy's commitment to the Aukus Pacific defence partnership with Australia and the United States, while investing £15billion in warheads. But the first of these UK-built submarines is not expected to enter service before the late 2030s.\\xa0 It will also be for future Parliaments to honour the spending commitment. The Conservatives have seized on on Labour's muddle on defence, accusing Mr Healey of weakening UK security. Tory defence spokesman James Cartlidge told the Mail: 'These promises on submarines are a fantasy fleet without real money to back them up. 'The fact is, John Healey has been forced into a humiliating climb down by the Treasury after confirming, as recently as Thursday, that defence spending would definitely rise to 3 per cent. 'But by Sunday he was backtracking completely. John Healey has been badly let down by the Chancellor – so now he knows how the rest of us feel.' \\n\\t    Share what you think\\n           The comments below have not been moderated. \\n      The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\\n     By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.

Asked by BBC Radio 4’s Today programme if UK armed forces could be deployed in the defence of a Nato ally, Sir Keir Starmer said: “In order to make sure that that isn’t the case, we need to prepare.” The UK “cannot ignore the threat that Russia poses,” he added. “Russia has shown in recent weeks that it’s not serious about peace, and we have to be ready.” Sir Keir Starmer said he was buoyed by the footage of Ukraine’s mass drone attack in Russia overnight which is reported to have destroyed 40 Russian planes. “[It shows] Ukraine is not defeated,” he told the BBC. “It shows they are still there and fighting . That is a tribute to Ukraine.” The prime minister said the three-year war between Ukraine and Russia had turned the Ukrainian army into one of Europe’s toughest fighting forces. Sir Keir Starmer rejected suggestions his Labour government could not commit the extra £13 billion to reach the 3 per cent defence funding figure because it was being forced to back down on other measures such as the winter fuel allowance. The government is preparing to reverse its tough cuts to fuel subsidies for pensioners, but the prime minister said it would not come at the cost of defence and security. He said he had fixed the 2.5 per cent defence funding figure to 2027, but the 3 per cent figure would not be tied to a particular date. “I am not going to indulge in the fantasy of plucking dates from the air,” he told the BBC. “I take the defence and security of our country very seriously. It’s the most important task I have.” The prime minister said he was hopeful of reaching the 3 per cent defence funding figure, but made no promises. Sir Keir Starmer said that all Nato countries needed to “step up” to boost defence spending in the current geopolitical environment. He said that defence spending would reach 2.5 per cent by 2027-28, but denied it was “wishful thinking” to hit 3 per cent by next parliament. “Yes, that 3 per cent [is the target]. But I am not going to make a commitment to the exact date until we can make good on that commitment,” he told the BBC. Sir Keir Starmer said the defence strategic review was needed because the “world has changed”, especially since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “We have to recognise the world has changed and if the world has changed we have to be ready,” he told the BBC. If you want to deter conflict, then you have to prepare for conflict.” The prime minister played down the prospect of a future nuclear warfare, but said nuclear deterrence had been an effective tool since the end of the Second World War. “We need to ask how Nato can preserve the peace for decades to come,” he said. Luke Pollard, the armed forces minister, has refused to guarantee that defence spending would reach 3 per cent of GDP, saying it would only happen when “economic conditions allow”. Before the release of the strategic defence review today, Pollard said he hoped to top the 3 per cent figure by the next parliament. “Well, we’ve set out that we are spending 2.5 per cent by April 2027 with the ambition to spend 3 per cent in the next parliament when economic conditions allow,” he told Times Radio. “I agree with the defence secretary that thanks to the chancellor getting our economy back on track by having the highest growth in the G7 that I have no doubt, just as a defence secretary doesn’t, that with the growing threats that we’re facing that we will be spending 3 per cent in the next parliament.” Please enable cookies and other technologies to view this content.

Britain will build up to a dozen nuclear-powered attack submarines, Sir Keir Starmer is expected to announce as the government unveils its strategic defence review on Monday. The long-awaited review will set out the UK’s defence plan for the next ten years. The boats will replace the UK’s seven Astute class submarines, which are armed with conventional weapons, and will be in operation from the late 2030s, joining the four Trident submarines that carry the nation’s at-sea nuclear deterrent.

Registered in England No. 894646. Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, SE1 9GF.', '“What you should do in defence is decide what you need, your capability, and then provide for it,” Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters, adding his government had already committed to accelerating A$10 billion in defence spending for the next four years. “We’re continuing to lift up,” he said, citing a 2.3% goal for 2033 previously set by his government. Hegseth and Australian defence minister Richard Marles discussed security issues, including accelerating US defence capabilities in Australia and advancing industrial base cooperation during a meeting on Friday, a Pentagon statement said today. “On defence spending, secretary Hegseth conveyed that Australia should increase its defence spending to 3.5% of its GDP as soon as possible,” the statement said. The ministers’ meeting on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia’s premier security forum, is only the second between the security allies since US President Donald Trump took office in January. Albanese, who was re-elected in May and is yet to meet Trump, did not raise defence spending in this year’s national budget, saying his government had already announced a A$50 billion boost over a decade. Peter Dean, director of foreign policy and defence at the University of Sydney’s US studies centre, said Albanese was positioning ahead of his first meeting with Trump, where the pair are also expected to discuss tariffs. “Albanese would want the decision on a defence boost to be seen as a sovereign one not imposed by Trump, after the election showed standing up for Australia was popular domestically,” he said. “Australia’s defence spending in 1987 was around 3% of GDP or 10% of the national budget, compared to 2% of GDP or 6% of the budget in 2025,” he said. “To achieve self-reliance in the modern era, with the threat from China, and within our region, it is going to cost more money,” Dean said. “The US would spend 3.5% of GDP on defence this year,” he added. Australia has committed to spend A$368 billion over three decades on the AUKUS programme to acquire and build nuclear powered submarines, and is also boosting missile acquisition and manufacture.

The US secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, met Australia’s defence minister, Richard Marles over the weekend in Singapore as part of the Shangri-la Dialogue. In a readout of the meeting released Monday morning Australian time, Hegseth conveyed that Australia should increase its defence spending to 3.5% of its GDP “as soon as possible”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Australia is on track to lift defence spending from about $53bn a year, or about 2% of GDP – to an estimated $100bn, or 2.4% of GDP, by 2033-34. An additional annual spend of about $40bn would be required by 2033-34 to reach 3.5% of GDP. Hegseth on Saturday urged countries in Asia to “share the burden” and lift defence spending to 5% of GDP, warning “Beijing is credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific” in a speech at the conference. It followed months after Pentagon undersecretary Elbridge Colby told a US Senate hearing that the US wanted Australia to reach a 3% defence spending threshold. Albanese was asked on Monday to respond to the US’s calls for Australia to pour billions more into its defence budget, to meet a higher spending target. The prime minister asked: “Which one?” “There’s been a range of [spending targets] going forward. What you should do in defence is decide what you need, your capability, and then provide for it. That’s what my government is doing,” he said. “What we need is things that defend us in real terms, and that’s what we’ll provide.” The prime minister had stood firm on Sunday, saying in response to a similar question about Hegseth’s Saturday comments: “We’ll determine our defence policy.” Also speaking on Sunday, Marles said the issue of defence spending was a conversation he was “totally up for”. Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion “The Americans have been very clear about wanting to see more from their friends and allies around the world. It’s a sentiment that we understand,” Marles said at a press conference in Singapore. “We have already engaged in the last couple of years in the single biggest peacetime increase in defence expenditure in Australia’s history. So we are beginning this journey. We’ve got runs on the board. “And indeed, if we look at Aukus, I mean, Aukus is something which is seeing our defence expenditure increase – as it should – and so we actually are taking steps down this path.” In February, Australia paid $US500m ($AUD790m) to the US as part of the first instalment in a total of $US3bn pledged in order to support America’s shipbuilding industry. At the time, Marles said Aukus was “a powerful symbol of our two countries working together in the Indo-Pacific”. Albanese is expected to meet Trump in person for the first time since both leaders were re-elected, on the sidelines of the G7 leaders’ summit in Canada this month. The two leaders are expected to discuss defence cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, as well as the US’s doubling of tariffs to 50% on steel and aluminium imports, including from Australia, beginning this week.', 'Our Solutions provide accurate, reliable financial data and cutting-edge analytical tools to help you harness the complexities of financial markets.

Connect with us via Editorial Support\\nLooking to connect with our Editorial support please send us June 02, 2025 (MLN):\\xa0Pakistan has projected a GDP growth target of 4.2% for fiscal year 2025-26,\\xa0signaling a broad-based recovery, as per copy of the proposed annual plan available to Mettis Global. The commodity-producing sectors are forecasted to expand by 4.4%, driven by a 4.5% rebound in agriculture and 3.5% positive growth in Large Scale Manufacturing. Agriculture growth will be supported by a recovery in important crops (6.7%) and cotton ginning (7%), as well as robust performance in livestock. The industrial sector is expected to benefit from a significant revival in Large-Scale manufacturing (3.5%), positive growth in mining and quarrying (3%), alongside sustained growth momentum in Construction and Energy, Gas and water supply. The services sector, which forms the largest share of GDP, is set to grow by 4%, underpinned by stronger performance in wholesale and retail trade, transport, storage & communications, financial services and real estate. These projections suggest cautious optimism, contingent on effective macroeconomic management and stable external conditions. National savings are expected to remain at 14.3% of GDP in FY 2025-26, financing a total investment of 14.7% of GDP, up from 13.8% in FY 2024-25. This reflects a narrowing saving-investment gap to be financed through modest external inflows. According to the document, public investment is projected to increase from 2.9% to 3.2% of GDP, while private investment is expected to rise from 9.1% to 9.8%. Fiscal and monetary policies will focus on consolidation and stability, with inflation projected at 7.5% due to the low base effect and risks from ongoing trade tensions and domestic tariff rationalization measures. The external sector may face pressure, as easing import controls and debt repayments are likely to widen the current account deficit. Yet, strong remittances, export recovery, and anticipated external financing are expected to cushion these pressures and support external sustainability.

Most likely, consumption was the driving force of the growth, while a negative contribution, if any, may be seen on the net exports side. In Slovakia, together with the GDP structure, the labor market data will be worth a look. Based on monthly data, the unemployment rate in the first quarter is likely to be the lowest in history. May’s flash inflation figures will be released in Croatia and Czechia. In Poland and Slovenia, we have seen easing inflationary pressure in May. Other than that, we will also see retail sales and industrial output numbers for April in several countries. We will watch Hungary in particular to see how the second quarter begins, given the weak economic performance in 1Q25. Finally, on Friday, Fitch will review the rating and outlook for Hungary. Last time, the negative outlook was changed to stable, but we worry that we may see the negative outlook being restored, given the deteriorating economic developments in Hungary. Over the last week, the Czech koruna has depreciated against the euro, while the Polish zloty, in contrast, strengthened against the euro. Such a development was observed before the outcome of the presidential election in Poland, which may leave a mark on the local FX market in the coming week. Romania held a repo auction to provide liquidity at the 6.5% key rate, instead of the credit facility of 7.5%. This is the first repo announcement since November 2018. In the US, a federal appeals court temporarily reinstated the most sweeping of President Donald Trump\\'s tariffs on Thursday, a day after a US trade court ruled that Trump had exceeded his authority in imposing the duties and ordered an immediate block on them. The uncertainty on the markets remains elevated. This week, the ECB holds a rate setting meeting on June 5. Locally, Poland’s central bank will announce its interest rate decision on Wednesday; stability of rates is expected at this time. The next move is anticipated only after the new growth and inflation projections are released at the beginning of July. Long-term yields have declined across the region over the last week. The local markets follow developments on the major markets, where, ahead of the ECB meeting this week, 10Y yields went down. In Romania, discussions about the new government are taking place, but there is no news at this point about the progress in that matter. In Hungary, government papers remain attractive, but at a higher price. This week, Slovakia, Croatia, Hungary and Czechia will be active on the bond market.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously set out a \"clear ambition\" to raise defence spending to 3% in the next parliament \"subject to economic and fiscal conditions\". Mr Healey has now told The Times newspaper there is a \"certain decade of rising defence spending\" to come, adding that this commitment \"allows us to plan for the long term. It allows us to deal with the pressures.\" A government source insisted the defence secretary was \"expressing an opinion, which is that he has full confidence that the government will be able to deliver on its ambition\", rather than making a new commitment. The UK currently spends 2.3% of GDP on defence, with Sir Keir announcing plans to increase that to 2.5% by 2027 in February. \\n                  Strategic Defence Review: UK \\'moving to warfighting readiness\\' as it commits to build attack submarines\\n                 \\n                  Britain has \\'lost control\\' of its borders, defence secretary tells Sky News\\n                 \\n                  New UK weapons factories to be built \\'very soon\\', Defence Secretary John Healey reveals\\n                 This followed mounting pressure from the White House for European nations to do more to take on responsibility for their own security and the defence of Ukraine. The 2.3% to 2.5% increase is being paid for by controversial cuts to the international aid budget, but there are big questions over where the funding for a 3% rise would be found, given the tight state of government finances. While a commitment will help underpin the planning assumptions made in the SDR, there is of course no guarantee a Labour government would still be in power during the next parliament to have to fulfil that pledge. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  A statement from the Ministry of Defence makes it clear that the official government position has not changed in line with the defence secretary\\'s comments. The statement reads: \"This government has announced the largest sustained increase to defence spending since the end of the Cold War - 2.5% by 2027 and 3% in the next parliament when fiscal and economic conditions allow, including an extra £5bn this financial year. \"The SDR will rightly set the vision for how that uplift will be spent, including new capabilities to put us at the leading edge of innovation in NATO, investment in our people and making defence an engine for growth across the UK - making Britain more secure at home and strong abroad.\" Follow our channel and never miss an update. Sir Keir commissioned the review shortly after taking office in July 2024. It is being led by Lord Robertson, a former Labour defence secretary and NATO secretary general. The Ministry of Defence has already trailed a number of announcements as part of the review, including plans for a new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command and a £1bn battlefield system known as the Digital Targeting Web, which we\\'re told will \"better connect armed forces weapons systems and allow battlefield decisions for targeting enemy threats to be made and executed faster\".

Mr Healey pledged to \"turn round what has been a national scandal for decades\", with 8,000 military family homes currently unfit for habitation. He said: \"The Strategic Defence Review, in the broad, will recognise that the fact that the world is changing, threats are increasing. \"In this new era of threat, we need a new era for defence and so the Strategic Defence Review will be the vision and direction for the way that we\\'ve got to strengthen our armed forces to make us more secure at home, stronger abroad, but also learn the lessons from Ukraine as well. \"So an armed forces that can be more capable of innovation more quickly, stronger to deter the threats that we face and always with people at the heart of our forces… which is why the housing commitments that we make through this strategic defence review are so important for the future.\"', ' LEARN  COSTS  BENEFITS  TOOLS AND REGULATIONS Get your Welcome Bonus of up to S$2,088  POPULAR MARKETS  MORE MARKETS  TRADING HOURS  INSIGHTS Trade when others can\\'t  PLATFORMS AND FEATURES  INTEGRATION OPTIONS  THIRD PARTY PLATFORMS  FIND THE RIGHT PLATFORMS Practise trading without losing money  STRATEGY  NEWS AND EVENTS  EDUCATION  TOOLS Become a master trader  OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU  FINANCIAL  CONTACT Got a question about trading?

Written by Tony Sycamore  Market Analyst The AUD/USD finished lower last week at 0.6431 (-0.98%), reversing after hitting a fresh six-month high of 0.6537 at the start of the week. The decline in the Australian dollar followed a batch of weak domestic data across retail sales, building approvals and capex. Support for the US dollar came from President Trump\\'s decision to once again back down on tariffs, this time on Europe. Month-end rebalancing flows also bolstered the greenback. The AUD/USD has rebounded at the start of the new week, hitting a high of 0.6472 this morning after President Donald Trump announced on Friday after markets closed that tariffs on steel and aluminium imports would increase from 25% to 50%, effective June 4, 2025. Staying on the subject of tariffs, last week\\'s US Court of International Trade decision to block most of Trump\\'s tariffs was a temporary setback, with the White House expected to use alternative legal avenues to achieve its tariff goals. A key factor is the increasing focus on revenue, given the large deficits linked to Trump\\'s tax bill, currently under Senate review ahead of the July 4 signing deadline. Higher tariffs and larger fiscal deficits are expected to continue to exert pressure on the USD in the weeks ahead. Apart from tariff developments, the AUD/USD will also be influenced by risk sentiment and this week\\'s key US data, including ISM PMIs, JOLTS job openings, and Friday\\'s crucial US non-farm payrolls. Locally, attention will be on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) meeting minutes tomorrow, which will be scrutinised for insights into the discussions for and against a 50basis point (bp) RBA cut last month, as well as Wednesday\\'s Q1 2025 GDP previewed below. In the last quarter (Q4 2024), Australian GDP increased by 0.6% for an annual rate of 1.3%. It was the Australian economy\\'s thirteenth consecutive quarter of growth and the highest reading since Q4 2022. Importantly, GDP per capita grew 0.1% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), snapping seven consecutive quarters of falls. Katherine Keenan, ABS head of national accounts, said: \\'Modest growth was seen broadly across the economy this quarter. Both public and private spending contributed to the growth, supported by a rise in exports of goods and services.\\' The rise in Q4 2024 GDP supported the idea that growth in the Australian economy bottomed out at 0.8% year-on-year (YoY) in Q3 and that a rebound is underway. Recent history of AU annual GDP As we await the final partial components for this week\\'s Q1 2025 GDP print, the preliminary forecast is for a rise of 0.4% QoQ, lifting the annual growth rate to 1.5% - on track to meet the RBA\\'s forecasts of 1.8% for June 2025 and 2.1% for December 2025. Ahead of the data, the Australian interest rates market is pricing in a 70% chance of a 25bp rate cut in July and a cumulative 75bp of RBA rate cuts between now and year-end. After completing a triangle-style \"ABCDE\" five-wave correction in early April at the 0.6389 high, the AUD/USD dropped to a low of 0.5912 on April 9. From there, it springboarded back above 0.6500 in early May, leaving a V-shaped bottom in its wake, frequently seen at medium-term lows. The AUD/USD has spent the past month consolidating its rebound from the April lows in a range between 0.6350 and 0.6540 - either side of the 200-day moving average, currently at 0.6446. After the current period of consolidation is completed (which may include a dip back towards 0.6350), we look for the AUD/USD to extend its gains towards medium-term resistance at 0.6740/50. This includes the 200-week moving average and the downtrend line from the 0.8007 high of February 2021.

Traders will focus on Q1 GDP data to see if a slowing economy warrants an RBA cut in July. \\r\\n                Share this:\\r\\n             View related analysis:  \\xa0 \\xa0  Australia’s retail trade slipped -0.1% in May according to the ABS, in further signs that the economy is slowing. It will be interesting to see if household spending contracts further when April’s data is released on Thursday, given it fell -0.3% in March. ANZ also reported that job adverts contracted for a second consecutive month in May, which points towards a slowing jobs market. On Tuesday we’ll see company profits and net exports contribution to GDP, which could help refine last-minute calls on Wedensday’s Q1 growth figures.  \\xa0 Australia’s GDP is forecast to have risen 1.5% y/y in Q1 and 0.4% q/q. Anything less simply bolsters bets of a July cut. RBA cash rate futures currently imply a 73% chance of a July cut and an end-of-year cash rate of 3.1%.  \\xa0  \\xa0 The RBA minutes are released on are unlikely to shed any new light of the prospects of a July cut given events this week. Odds of another 25bp cut on July 8 have fallen to 59% from 78% ahead of the monthly inflation report. While CPI remains within the RBA’s 2-3% target band, trimmed mean CPI rose to 2.7% from 2.6% and headline CPI rose remained at 2.4% compared to 2.3% expected. And that was before Trump’s tariffs were effectively cancelled and reinstated within 24 hours, spurring a bout of unwelcome volatility that the RBA were sure to have noted.\\xa0  \\xa0 Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell is to deliver remarks at the 75th anniversary of International Finance, though he is not expected to be commenting on monetary policy at this event. That said, traders will still be tuning in for any subtle cues, regardless. Though Powell’s recent comments have highlighted data dependence, and he’s unlikely to stray far from that line. \\xa0 \\xa0 The Chinese yuan, copper and gold continued to share a strong positive correlation with AUD/USD, and its relationship with the AU-US 2 year spread has effectively broken down.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Only minor adjustments were made to AUD/USD futures positioning last week, with large speculators increasing their net-short exposure by 2.1k contracts and asset managers decreased their by -2.8k contracts.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0  \\xa0 The v-bottom rally has stalled around a 61.8% Fibonacci level, with two false breaks of 65c. The sharp reversal back into the 64 – 65c range left a shooting star candle at its high, which could temp bears to fade into moves towards 65c. And with AUD/USD likely to remain rangebound of the foreseeable future, traders are likely to seek dips to 0.64000 or 0.6356 to trade the range is currently stuck in.  \\xa0 \\xa0 -- Written by Matt Simpson Follow Matt on Twitter\\xa0@cLeverEdge \\xa0 \\r\\n                Share this:\\r\\n             Experience award-winning platforms with fast and secure execution.\\n Experience award-winning platforms with fast and secure execution.

', '', \"---Advertisement--- India’s benchmark share market indices, Sensex and Nifty50, started the day’s trade in red on Monday, June 2, 2025. The Sensex (30 firms index) tumbled 236.59 points to open at 81,214.42 on Monday. Meanwhile, Nifty50 (index with top 50 firms) was also down 81 points to open at 24,669.70 points. Indian share market was weighed down by global concerns despite strong domestic GDP figures. The benchmark indices slipped in early trade on Monday, with investor sentiment dampened by renewed tariff threats from US President Donald Trump. The pressure came amid Trump’s announcement to revise tariffs on steel and aluminium, reigniting fears of a trade war and economic strain. On the National Stock Exchange (NSE), sectoral indices displayed a mixed trend. Except for Nifty FMCG and Nifty PSU Bank, all other sectoral indices opened in the red, highlighting broad-based selling pressure. Nifty IT emerged as the worst performer among the indices, declining by 1.28%, indicating strong selling pressure in the technology sector. Nifty Bank also saw a decline of 0.5%, Nifty 100 fell by 0.68 per cent, while Nifty Smallcap was down by 0.43%. The Midcap index showed relative resilience, but still opened 0.10% lower. The negative sentiment was not confined to Indian markets alone. Other major Asian markets also opened weak on Monday. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped by more than 1.45%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index declined over 2.3%, Taiwan’s Weighted index lost 1.61%, and Indonesia’s Jakarta Composite fell by 1.44%.  Market experts noted that while India’s macroeconomic fundamentals remain strong, as reflected in the robust GDP numbers, the external headwinds triggered by the US tariff revision have overshadowed the domestic positives. The threat of a wider impact on global trade and capital flows has made investors cautious. Ajay Bagga, Banking and Market Expert, told ANI, “Asian markets are down as tariff tantrums and tax uncertainty rule sentiments. China-US public spat is not being taken seriously, given the rollback they did a month back after posturing. The 50% Steel and Aluminium tariffs announced by Trump from July 4th are a bit of a 1% type dampener.” He further added, “Ukraine Russia conflict widening is a risk, but markets are ignoring it for now. Indian markets should have done well today on the back of a superb March quarter GDP print and expectations of a rate cut and further monetary easing at the RBI MPC later this week. However, the global weakness is holding the Indian markets also in its grip today.” Sunil Gurjar, SEBI-registered research analyst and founder of Alphamojo Financial Services said, “Currently, the price is trading between a hurdle and support. A breakout above resistance would indicate a continuation of the uptrend in the sector. The Indian stock market concluded the week with mixed results, as benchmark indices registered their second consecutive weekly decline, while the broader market experienced some growth.” ALSO READ: India’s Defence Production Hits Rs 1.46 Trillion In FY25, Private Sector Contribution Soars As Exports Cross Rs 24,000 Crore  Read more about our editorial guidelines and standards here.

On Monday, benchmark indices witnessed declines as investor sentiment suffered amidst renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. Opening at 24,669.70, the Nifty 50 index noted a dip of 81.00 points or 0.33 percent. Similarly, the BSE Sensex opened lower at 81,214.42, down 236.59 points or 0.29 percent. The downward trajectory continued into early trade, driven largely by Trump's tariff announcements on steel and aluminum, stirring fears of a trade war and economic strain. Market analysts highlighted that India's macroeconomic foundations remain solid, as shown by strong GDP outcomes. However, external challenges from the U.S. tariff adjustments have overshadowed domestic positives, creating caution among investors. Ajay Bagga, a banking and market expert, commented to ANI on the negative sentiment affecting Asian markets, partially due to U.S.-China tensions. Yet, domestic factors such as the March quarter GDP report and anticipated RBI monetary easing offered some optimism, stifled by global market weaknesses. Sectoral indices, save for Nifty FMCG and Nifty PSU Bank, mostly opened in the red, forecasting widespread selling pressure. Nifty IT stood as the indices' weakest link, dropping 1.28 percent, reflecting intense selling in the technology sector. The Nifty Bank fell by 0.5 percent, Nifty 100 shrank by 0.68 percent, and the Nifty Smallcap decreased by 0.43 percent. Although showing some resilience, the Midcap index opened 0.10 percent lower. Sunil Gurjar, a SEBI-registered research analyst and founder of Alphamojo Financial Services observed that prices hover between resistance and support, yet a breakout could signal a sector uptrend continuation. Other key Asian markets also presented a weak opening Monday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 reducing by over 1.4 percent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index by 2.3 percent, Taiwan's Weighted index by 1.61 percent, and Indonesia's Jakarta Composite by 1.44 percent.

FY25 GDP growth may have stayed at 6.5% for FY25, but the Q4 was the best in terms of real GDP growth at 7.4%. This is sharply higher than 6.5%, 5.6%, and 6.4% respectively in Q1, Q2, and Q3 of FY25. What were the big drivers of growth in Q4FY25? Construction saw real growth of 10.8% in Q4FY25; followed by public services & defence at 8.7%, and financial services at 7.8%. Interestingly, primary sector growth (agriculture, forestry, mining, and quarrying) expanded 4.4% in Q4FY25, compared to 2.7% in Q4FY24. One key favourable trigger in Q4FY25 was the sharp fall in merchandise imports. FY25 NOMINAL GVA AND NOMINAL GDP (PROVISIONAL ESTIMATE) Real GDP may be the standard measures of economic growth, but nominal GDP (pre-inflation) is a barometer of jobs, fiscal deficit, and economic activity. (₹ in Crore) (₹ in Crore) Data Source: MOSPI There are key takeaways from nominal GDP data. Firstly, nominal GDP growth and nominal GVA growth at 9.8% and 9.5% were impressive. Data shows that inflation has substantially stabilized. What were the big drivers of nominal GDP growth in FY25? In the primary sector, while mining suffered, the agricultural output was better in FY25, as compared to FY24. Manufacturing fell 460 bps in nominal terms to 6.3% in FY25; largely due to weak capex spending in last two years. Growth in electricity output fell 80% in FY25 in nominal terms compared to FY24. Services growth was lower compared to FY24; but it helped FY25 close with a respectable figure. Overall, FY25 was better in agriculture but modest in key services and construction. However, it was core manufacturing that lagged in FY25. REAL GVA AND REAL GDP FOR FY25 (PROVISIONAL ESTIMATES) The table below captures the sector wise break up of real GDP (net of inflation) for FY25, juxtaposed with FY24 and FY23. (₹ in Crore) (₹ in Crore) FY24 FY25 Data Source: MOSPI Real GDP growth at 6.5%, was lower than previous years, but not disappointing. Firstly, it is on a higher base and secondly, it comes amidst tumult in global markets and policy flux. The big gains in FY25, in real terms, came from agriculture. Real farm growth is 190 bps higher at 4.6% in FY25. Manufacturing has taken a sharp hit in FY25, falling from 12.3% to 4.5%; largely due to weak capex. Of course, the construction sector has been robust, while government did its bit through spending on public services and defence. The moral of the story is; at 6.5%, real growth in India is still enviable. Among the global large economies, India remains the fastest growing; for the fourth year in a row!

Similarly, the Nifty slipped 182.60 points or 0.74 per cent to 24,568.10 after opening at 24,669.70, compared to its previous close of 24,750.70 at 9.30 am, as escalating US-China trade tensions and global uncertainties weighed on investor sentiment despite stronger-than-expected domestic GDP data. The benchmark indices extended last week’s losses, with the Nifty ending 0.41 per cent lower and the Sensex dropping 270 points for the week. Market volatility persisted as President Trump announced doubling steel tariffs to 50 per cent and accused China of violating trade agreements, signalling potential escalation between the world’s two largest economies. “President Trump’s 50 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium is a clear message that the tariff and trade scenario will continue to be uncertain and turbulent. This headwind will impact markets,” said Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited. Among individual stocks, Apollo Hospitals led the gainers with a 2.59 per cent surge to 7,058.50, followed by Hindustan Unilever gaining 1.29 per cent to 2,378.50. Adani Ports advanced 0.97 per cent to 1,446.70, while Bharat Electronics Limited climbed 0.94 per cent to 388.20 and Mahindra & Mahindra rose 0.84 per cent to 3,001.70. On the downside, HDFC Bank declined 1.67 per cent to 1,912.50, while Reliance Industries fell 1.59 per cent to 1,398.30. Technology stocks faced pressure with HCL Technologies dropping 1.59 per cent to 1,610.60 and Tech Mahindra declining 1.55 per cent to 1,549.50. Bajaj Auto rounded out the top losers, falling 1.49 per cent to 8,479.00. The banking sector showed mixed performance with Bank Nifty offering support despite overall market weakness. “Bank Nifty offered a silver lining with a 0.63 per cent gain, led by SBI’s 2.76 per cent surge,” noted Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research) at Mehta Equities Ltd. The PSU Bank index performed best among sectors last week, gaining over 4 per cent, while the FMCG index suffered the largest loss, dropping 2.29 per cent. India’s economic fundamentals provided some support as fourth-quarter GDP growth came in at 7.4 per cent, significantly exceeding expectations and marking the highest growth rate across all four quarters of FY25. Full-year growth reached 6.5 per cent, in line with official estimates. “India’s real GDP grew by 7.4 per cent in the fourth quarter, which is the highest growth rate achieved in all four quarters of FY25. This can be attributed to the higher government spending, robust industrial activity, and stable economic outlook amidst tariff wars and geopolitical tensions,” said Ajay Garg, CEO of SMC Global Securities. The strong GDP performance was driven by manufacturing, construction, and financial services sectors. Private consumption remained healthy with Private Final Consumption Expenditure increasing 7.2 per cent in FY25 compared to 5.6 per cent in the previous financial year. “The recovery in manufacturing and construction was largely in line with expectations. It was likely supported by strategic inventory front-loading by firms in anticipation of reciprocal tariff measures and by strong government capital expenditure,” explained Ms. Rajani Sinha, Chief Economist at CareEdge Ratings. Technical analysts remained cautious about near-term market direction. “Volatility is expected to persist as both buyers and sellers remain cautious; technically, Nifty turns bullish only above 25,116, with key support at 24,363,” Tapse added. Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research at Kotak Securities, identified key levels for the week. “We believe that the 20-day Simple Moving Average and the level of 24,650 would serve as key support zones for short-term traders, while the 25,150 level could act as a significant resistance area for the bulls,” he said. Commodity markets reflected global tensions with crude oil futures trading higher after Ukraine launched drone attacks on Russian airbases. August Brent oil futures rose 2.18 per cent to $64.15, while July WTI crude gained 2.62 per cent to $62.38. “Crude oil prices remained highly volatile last week, initially rising before retreating sharply toward the weekend. The sell-off came after OPEC+ announced a production hike of 411,000 barrels per day starting in July,” said Rahul Kalantri, VP Commodities at Mehta Equities Ltd. Gold faced pressure from a stronger dollar and geopolitical uncertainties. “Gold posted a weekly decline as the US dollar gained strength, driven by fresh economic data suggesting the Federal Reserve may delay interest rate cuts until later this year,” commented Aksha Kamboj, Vice President of India Bullion and Jewellers Association. Sector performance showed IT, Metal, Media, and Energy outperforming in May, with gains of 4.3 per cent, 7.35 per cent, 10.33 per cent, and 4.21 per cent respectively. Most sectors finished May with 1-2.5 per cent gains, except for Nifty Defence. Market participants now await the RBI’s rate decision on June 6, with expectations of continued monetary easing to support economic growth. “This paves the way for the RBI to go with another repo rate cut in the June meeting to support the ongoing economic growth,” Garg noted. Despite global headwinds, analysts remain optimistic about India’s long-term prospects. “The Indian economy seems to be insulated from the geopolitical worries and will continue to attract robust foreign investments,” Garg concluded, citing the country’s stable economic outlook and robust domestic demand fundamentals.

The Gift Nifty was trading at 24,841.5 as of 8:07 AM, indicating a positive opening for benchmark indices, with Nifty 50 likely to open above Friday’s close of 24,750.7. India's GDP expanded by 7.4% in the fourth quarter (January–March), outperforming consensus estimates. The growth was largely fueled by robust activity in the construction and manufacturing sectors, suggesting underlying strength in industrial demand and infrastructure spending. This upbeat data has reinforced confidence in the domestic economic recovery and is likely to drive early market gains. Sectors in Focus: Banking and Financials: Traders are closely watching rate-sensitive stocks as the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy decision approaches later this week. Expectations are that the RBI may maintain its current stance while monitoring inflation trends. Auto and Real Estate: Both sectors stand to benefit from economic momentum and expectations of continued policy support. Auto sales data for May, set to be released during the week, could further influence investor sentiment. Construction & Capital Goods: Stocks in these sectors may see renewed buying interest following the GDP report highlighting their contribution to growth. Global cues remain mixed, with US markets ending Friday slightly higher amid speculation on the Federal Reserve’s rate path. Asian markets opened cautiously today, reflecting global macro uncertainties, but India's domestic narrative remains more optimistic. Key Levels to Watch: Nifty 50: Immediate resistance seen near 24,900; support at 24,650 Sensex: May track similar gains, eyeing new all-time highs Investors will also keep an eye on foreign institutional inflows, corporate commentary, and macro updates through the week, including the upcoming RBI policy meet and US payroll data.

The GVA (gross value added) grew by 6.8 per cent in Q4 and 6.4 per cent in FY25. Core GVA grew by 6.4 per cent in FY25. Nominal GDP grew by 9.8 per cent in FY25, in line with flat growth in the GDP deflator indicating broad-based correction in domestic prices. The gap between GDP and GVA of 60 bps is due to higher net indirect taxes which grew by 12.7 per cent.   From the production side, all sectors exhibited better growth numbers in Q4. While industry grew by 6.5 per cent, the services sector grew by 7.3 per cent in Q4. Within industry, construction sector alone grew by whopping 10.8 per cent in Q4 and manufacturing sector increased by 4.8 per cent.   Government’s fiscal deficit marginally exceeded the revised estimate for FY25 by Rs 77 billion, albeit led by a welcome overshooting in capital expenditure amid a less palatable miss on the receipts side being largely offset by considerable savings of Rs 0.9 trillion in revenue expenditure in the fiscal.    The upward revision in the FY26 nominal GDP number also augurs well for meeting the deficit and debt to GDP targets for FY26.    Despite a relatively lower projected nominal GDP growth of 9.0 per cent in FY26 vis-à-vis the budgeted levels of 10.1 per cent, the fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio can be contained at 4.4 per cent in FY26, as per Icra, while also accommodating a marginal fiscal slippage, given the larger base. This, along with the additional cushion on the receipts side on account of the higher-than-budgeted RBI dividend transfer, provides comfort on the fiscal front amidst heightened global uncertainties.   The government’s capex surged by 61 per cent to Rs 1.6 trillion in April. However, this was offset by the modest contraction in revex in the month, which contained the growth in total expenditure to 10 per cent. Given this, and the 21 per cent growth in revenue receipts, the fiscal deficit was limited at Rs 1.9 trillion in April.   India’s economy has maintained a steady growth trajectory, with real GDP expanding by 6.5 per cent in FY 2024-25. In nominal terms, GDP grew by 9.8 per cent highlighting India’s position as one of the fastest-growing major economies globally.   The growth was, as per PHDCCI, largely driven by healthy growth in private consumption, and capital formation. The Private Final Consumption Expenditure increased by 7.2 per cent, while Gross Fixed Capital Formation rose by 7.1 per cent in Q4, reflecting investment-led momentum.   Per capita GDP in real terms increased by 5.5 per cent, reaching `1.33 lakh, while per capita Gross National Income stood at `1.31 lakh, marking a 5.4 per cent rise.    These gains suggest broad-based improvements in economic well-being.  Stay in the loop with the latest buzz! Subscribe to\\xa0our\\xa0newsletter  ©\\xa02025\\xa0BizzBuzz.

Around 9:25 am, the BSE Sensex was down 732.71 points at 80,718.30, while the NSE Nifty50 slipped 197.45 points to 24,553.25. Broader markets mirrored the weakness, with most indices in the red amid a spike in volatility. Despite strong domestic data, investor sentiment appears weighed down by mounting global concerns. “There are global headwinds like renewed tariff concerns that will restrain a breakout rally. At the same time there are domestic tailwinds that will support the market at lower levels,” said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. He flagged fresh global trade tensions as a key worry for equity markets. “President Trump’s 50% tariffs on steel and aluminium is a clear message that the tariff and trade scenario will continue to be uncertain and turbulent. This headwind will impact markets,” Vijayakumar added. Echoing similar concerns, Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, warned of possible turbulence on Dalal Street. “Market turbulence looms amid escalating US-China trade tensions, with President Trump accusing China of violating their agreement,” Tapse said. Still, India’s better-than-expected GDP figures offer comfort on the domestic front. “On the domestic front the tailwinds are getting stronger with the latest Q4 GDP growth data coming at 7.4%, which is much better-than-expected. Trends in consumption expenditure and capital expenditure are promising,” Vijayakumar said. “This along with low inflation and the expected continuation of the rate-cutting policy provide the perfect setting for sustained economic growth in FY26,” he noted, though he cautioned that corporate earnings growth remains a concern. “If leading indicators suggest a recovery in earnings growth there is a high probability of the market breaking out of the present range and moving higher.\" Adding to the risk-off mood, Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities, said Indian markets were likely to stay subdued despite the GDP print due to “heightened fears of escalating conflict between Ukraine and Russia.”NIFTY OUTLOOK Technical indicators suggest that Nifty may struggle to break out in the near term. “Persistent rejection trades seen last week on all upside attempts point towards the lack of momentum required for large upsides. We feel that a dip to 24,500 could improve such hopes. That said, slippage past the same could however expose 24,060, though a collapse is less expected,” said Anand James, Chief Market Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. “Alternatively, direct rise above 25,077 could clear path for intermediate objective of 25,235–25,460,” he addedPublished By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jun 2, 2025Must Watch \\n', 'Failed to retrieve the webpage.', 'India\\'s economic activity continued to improve, with the GDP growth rate rising to a four-quarter high of 7.4% in the January-March period.

The firm noted that real GDP growth at 7.4% YoY in the March quarter was higher than expected, surpassing the consensus expectation of 6.9% YoY. \"Our higher GDP forecast assumes no significant increase in the effective tariff rate against India and the overall global tariff situation remaining the same,\" UBS said. Morgan Stanley highlighted that growth in both GDP (7.4% YoY) and GVA (6.8% YoY) was higher than anticipated. \"The upside surprise was led by higher-than-anticipated growth in net indirect taxes on a YoY basis,\" the firm noted.  It expects GDP growth to soften to 6.2% YoY in FY26 amid headwinds from global external factors. The firm also pointed out that the upturn in GDP was driven by stronger growth in gross fixed capital formation, which rose to a six-quarter high of 9.4% YoY, while private consumption growth moderated to 6% YoY. \"Within industry, the pickup was led by a broad-based increase across sub-sectors, the strongest being for construction (10.8%), while manufacturing activity grew 4.8%. While services remained steady at the aggregate level, growing 7.3% YoY, the sub-sector trend was mixed,\" Morgan Stanley said.  BofA Securities maintained its FY26 GDP growth forecast at 6.3%. The firm noted that Q1 2025 GDP registered a strong print of 7.4% YoY, a significant recovery from 6.4% growth in Q4 2024. \"Even though growth rates have come broadly in line with our and market expectations, we believe incoming data does not indicate a sharp recovery from here,\" BofA Securities stated.  The firm expects agriculture to recover and remain resilient, with public spending likely adding significant momentum to investment growth. \"With 4% CPI inflation and 7% GDP growth, the hurdle for RBI\\'s MPC to cut rates again in June policy meeting is very low. We expect another 25bp cut in repo rate to 5.75% and continue to expect 5.50% as terminal rate by August 2025,\" BofA Securities said. Deutsche Bank Research reported that India\\'s Jan-March 2025 real GDP growth came in at 7.4% YoY, higher than their and Bloomberg\\'s consensus estimate of 6.8% YoY.  The firm attributed this to significantly lower subsidy disbursements, which boosted net tax collection growth. \"Manufacturing sector real GVA improved somewhat, recording a growth of 4.8% YoY in Jan-March 2025,\" Deutsche Bank Research noted. \"Manufacturing sector real GVA improved somewhat, recording a growth of 4.8% year-on-year in Jan-March 25 versus 3.6% YoY in Oct-Dec 24 and 2.2% year-on-year in July-Sep 24, which was in line with a rebound in corporate sector earnings, after a sharp fall in July-Sep 24,\" Deutsche said. Goldman Sachs highlighted that the central government met its revised fiscal deficit target of 4.8% of GDP for FY25. \"In March 2025, central government capex registered robust growth of 68% YoY, with the highest ever level of monthly spending,\" the firm stated.  Goldman Sachs expects the higher-than-budgeted dividend from the RBI to buffer any shortfall in income tax and aid in adhering to the fiscal consolidation path. \"In April, the overall expenditure increased by 10% year-on-year, mainly driven by capex, while revenue expenditure contracted by 5.7% year-on-year mainly due to lower interest payments. On the receipts side, direct taxes contracted in April, driven by a sharp contraction in corporate tax collections\" the brokerage said. Macquarie noted that Q4 FY25 GDP growth was driven mainly by higher capex. \"Gross fixed capital formation was strong at 9.4% YoY in Q4 FY25,\" the firm stated.  However, Macquarie pointed out that private consumption expenditure remains subdued at 6% YoY, with muted urban demand but stronger rural demand indicated by robust tractor sales. \"High frequency indicators like passenger car sales, two-wheeler sales and petrol consumption point towards muted urban demand. However, rural demand seems to be doing better as indicated by strong growth in tractor sales,\" Macquarie said.', \"Listen to Story The stock market is expected to open higher on Monday, June 2, following better-than-expected GDP numbers for the March quarter.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth conveyed the figure to Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles on the sidelines of the Shangri-la Dialogue security conference in Singapore over the weekend, where the pair held talks amid rising tensions with China. Australia currently spends about 1.9% of GDP on defense, or about 55.7 billion Australian dollars ($37 billion), and an immediate boost to 3.5% would take that to nearly AU$100 billion.

NATO target: 3.5% By the Sunday interviews Healey had reversed his line and said it was only an “ambition” to ramp up spending to that level. This morning on the Today Programme – a couple of hours before the Strategic Defence Review is launched – Starmer could not provide a guarantee: “What I said at the election in 2024 is that we would get to 2.5% and I was pressed time and again ‘what precise date’ and I said ‘as soon as I can be absolutely clear with a firm date, a firm commitment that we will keep to’, because I had seen the previous government make commitments about this percent or that percent with no plan behind it, I’m not going down that road. Therefore, what you can take from this is – yes – that 3% but I am not, as the Prime Minister of a Labour Government, going to make a commitment as to the precise date, until I couldn’t be sure precisely where the money is coming from, how we can make good on that commitment.” Investment recommendations are predicated on an increase in defence spending.
